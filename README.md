## Hello There

This is my repository for Michigan State's C++14 programming class (CSE-232). Its basically the same as 231 but in C++ and some other things that make it more challenging. Many of the projects are similar involving file input/output, Object-oriented programming, and of course various ways to store data using vectors and linked lists.

Thank you for looking!
